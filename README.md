# Movie Recommender System

This project is aimed at developing a movie recommendation system using Python. The system analyzes movie ratings data to provide personalized movie recommendations to users.

## Overview

The Movie Recommender System uses a dataset of movie ratings. It performs data analysis and visualization to understand the distribution of ratings and identify popular movies. The system then uses this information to recommend movies that a user might enjoy based on their past viewing history and ratings.

## Features

- **Data Analysis**: The system analyzes movie ratings to calculate the average rating and the number of ratings for each movie.
- **Data Visualization**: The system visualizes the distribution of ratings and the number of ratings using histograms and jointplots.
- **Recommendation**: The system recommends movies to users based on their past viewing history and ratings.

## Installation

Before running the scripts, you need to install the necessary Python libraries. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn IPython
```

This will install the following libraries:

- **pandas**: A library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools.
- **matplotlib**: A library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- **seaborn**: A Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
- **IPython**: An interactive command-line terminal for Python.

## Usage

The Movie Recommender System is implemented as a series of Python scripts. To use the system, run the main script and follow the prompts to rate movies and receive recommendations.
